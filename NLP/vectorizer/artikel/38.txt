Dealing With Dry Skin
Frequent bathing, cold weather and forgetting that daily dose of sunscreen all can contribute to dry skin.

The American Osteopathic College of Dermatology offers these suggestions to help prevent dry skin:

	Bathe no more than once daily, sticking to short (no more than 15 minutes) baths or showers with lukewarm water.
	Use a mild soap or gentle cleanser that won't dry the skin. Avoid deodorant soaps.
	Don't scrub the skin while bathing or drying.
	Apply a rich moisturizer as soon as you get out of the bath or shower.
	Use sunscreen daily.
	Use laundry detergent without fragrance, and avoid fabric softeners.
	Run a humidifier at home during the winter months.
