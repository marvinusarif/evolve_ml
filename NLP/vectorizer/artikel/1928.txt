Save Your Heart With Grains
Lup dup lup dup... Such a familiar sound that you will never miss it. That is your normal heart sound. But, are you sure that sound means that your heartâ€™s health is optimal and well?

Donâ€™t worry, there are many ways of caring your heart even in young age. One of them is by the help of grains.



Grains are the source of carbohydrate. But unlike the other sources, grains are rich on high fibers. One of the grains that we usually eat is oat.

Grains contain high fiber, folic acid, omega-3, vegetable protein, phytochemical, and antioxidant like vitamin E, selenium, copper, iron, and magnesium. They have a low level of lipid. Each 100 gram grains contains 3,1 mg of iron and 36 mg of calcium.

Joanne Slavin, a doctor from Minnesota University, says that, the nutrients in grains are useful for controlling blood pressure and preventing coronary heart disease.

In 1999, there was a research about the effect of oatmeal consumption toward the blood cholesterol level. The result said that the consumption of 70 mg of oatmeal routinely can bind the cholesterol and excrete it out of out body. This excretion can lower the risk of coronary heart disease by lowering the cholesterol level.

By consuming grains regularly, it will also benefit the digestive system by stimulating it to function better. Grains will also help excreting the toxin. More over, if we eat grains, they will help to stave off the hunger longer.  Hence, they help us to control our food intake and indirectly they will reduce the risk of obesity.

So, letâ€™s eat the grains everyday and save our heart!
