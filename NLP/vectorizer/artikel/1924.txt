Death by Curry 
Do you like Indonesian famous traditional foods such as chicken curry or rendang? Whoâ€™s not? Do you know that those foods can lead you to heart attack? Coconut milk is used to make a chicken curry and rendang. Once it is processed in our body, the content of coconut milk will be changed into cholesterol. High level of cholesterol in blood is one of the causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD).



According to the World Health Report 2001, 29% of death in Southeast Asia is caused by cardiovascular disease. Indonesia is among the countries, which showed that 200 in 100,000 people in Indonesia die from CVD.

Let us look further on the relationship of coconut milk, cholesterol, and heart disease.

&nbsp;

What Is A Coconut Milk?

Coconut milk is a natural white milk-coloured water-oil emulsion, extracted from coconut pulp, sometimes with the addition of water. The preliminary step to obtain the coconut milk is by grating the coconut to destroy and damage the pulp tissue containing coconut milk. Hand-juicing is done to put pressure on the grated coconut and forced the milk out of the pulps.

There are 2 kinds of coconut milks, the thick/condensed and the aqueous one. Thick coconut milk is usually used for dishes such as rendang, cakes or desserts. While the diluted coconut milk is usually used for soup such as lodeh(vegetable mix) and soto. There are also instant preparations of coconut milk in the market in the form of packed carton, frozen and even powder. However, the easiness of use (just add hot water) does not substitute the quality of fresh coconut milk.

&nbsp;

What Is The Actual Content of Coconut Milk?

Pure coconut milk naturally contains about 54% water, 35% fat, and 11% non-fat solids (± 6% carbohydrate, protein ± 4%, and other solids) which are classified as oil emulsions within water. Coconut milk also contains vitamins (vitamin C, B1, B3, B6, folate acid) and minerals (calcium, zinc, magnesium, iron, phosphorus). This composition varies greatly depending on the nature of the raw material (the palm trees, coconut), extraction method, and the amount of water added. The energy content per 100 grams of diluted coconut milk was 122 kcal.

What Are The Types of Cholesterol?

There are three types of cholesterol, namely:

	High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), has the most protein and least amount of cholesterol. HDL cholesterol is often referred to as good cholesterol because HDL releases cholesterol from cells and transport it to the liver to be partially eliminated from the body.
	Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), has less protein and more cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is often referred to as bad cholesterol because LDL transports cholesterol to cells, including cells lining the inner walls of blood vessels.
	Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), has the least amount of protein and the most fat, but it carries neutral fat, no cholesterol.

Rather than total cholesterol levels, more importantly the amount of cholesterol bound to various plasma protein carrier carries the risk of having heart disease.

What if my cholesterol level is high?

Increased level of cholesterol in blood is a major cause of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a degenerative and progressive disease of the arteries, creating blockage of blood vessels and decreasing the blood flow. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the plaque formation on the artery walls. Plaque is formed by cholesterol and other fats. Vessels then are exposed to more plaques until they become more severe. At that point, the blood vessels will be hard and difficult stretch. Hence, atherosclerosis is also known as the hardening of the arteries.

Atherosclerosis may occur in the entire arteries of the body, but the most serious consequence is when the vessel in the brain and heart are involved. In the brain, atherosclerosis is the main cause of stroke, whereas angina pectoris (chest pain), blockage of coronary arteries, and heart attack may occur if the coronary arteries of the heart is blocked completely by atherosclerosis. Heart attacks may lead to sudden death, slow death due to complications, complete functional recovery, or recovery with impaired cardiac function.

The cause of atherosclerosis remains unclear. There are several risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as genetic, obesity, advanced age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lack of exercise, nerve/psychological tension, and the most significant is the excess of cholesterol in the blood.

Skinny body does not mean you have lower level of cholesterol. High cholesterol can also be experienced by young people. We have to live a healthy lifestyle in all walks of life, in order to keep the level of cholesterol in blood remained normal. Moreover, it is advisable to do regular check of cholesterol level.
