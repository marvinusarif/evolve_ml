Kleine Levin Syndrome: Being A Sleeping Beauty
Kleine-Levine Syndrom  others known as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome or  Rip Van Winkle Syndrome is a neurological physiological conditions with a changes  or disturbance of behavioural and cognitive in a person that could be recognized in a cardinal signs.

According to American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2005, KLS is a rare disease characterized by recurrent episodes  of hypersomnia  ( prolonged sleeping duration )  and behavioural or cognitive disturbance, compulsive eating behaviour  and hypersexuality.

This cardinal signs are the increases and disturbance in some functional region part of body including:

	Disturbance of Sleep with Hypersomnolence or exaggerated amount of sleeping ( could be until 11 until 20 hours *1). Hypersomnia (excess extents of drowsiness) and are frequently given treatment originally for sleep disorders.
	Sexual Hyperactivity , uncontrollable increasing sexual drive
	Eating disturbance, Excessive food intake or Over eating ( Megaphagia )
	Depressed mood

They sleep duration increasing so extremely high until 20 Hours , when they awake may exhibit irritability, lack of energy (lethargy), and/or lack of emotions (apathy). They may also appear confused (disoriented) and experience hallucination.

In some cases, the symptoms associated with Kleine-Levin syndrome eventually disappear with advancing age. However, episodes may recur later during life.

Afflicted individuals might be asymptomatic for several weeks/ months/ years &amp; then the disorder rearing its ugly head yet again sans much caveat. Amid events those people identified with sleeping beauty syndrome seem to be sound health without any proof of dysfunction (physically/ behaviorally). Cognitive disturbance shows by the sign of lack of concentration, attention and memory defect.

Patient could also have a Derealization, hallucination and delusion : its a feeling of unreal , something seems wrong or disconnected of thinking during episode.

What are the cause of this Sleeping Beauty syndrome?

The causes of this Sleeping Beauty Syndrome is still in study and unknown. But there are couples of study and research in progress  that it could caused by :

	Hereditary factor ( genetic )
	Head Trauma
	Neurological disease  : after stroke
	Autoimmune disease
	Increases of  some part of Hormone : Thyroid - generally hypothyroid ( that explained the changed temperature and anxiety ), sex hormone and cortisol are studied in the relation with KLS. This could caused a weight gained in a patient because with a massive increasing food intake and a decreased activity in a person who suffered Sleeping Beauty syndrome.
	Malfunction of Brain Part especially limbic  area ( hypothalamic  and brain stem ) this part of brain controlled sense of Sleep, Sexual , Temperature and  Eating.
	Infection ( encephalitis, viral infection, Influenza , Urinary tract disease etc. )
	Alcohol consumptions

Who is likely to suffers ?

Most symptom especially hyperactivity of sexual and hallucination found in Men. But women experienced KLS more longer than men. The median range of Age usually at the age 15 years and onset duration of the disease approx. 8 years.

Any Laboratory or Medical examinations/founding that could help to diagnosed?

This disease is hard to detect because the clinical findings from body functional is merely normal. Blood test found normal, Lumbal Punction , CFS and viral serologies to detected if thereâ€™s any infection found normal, CT scan and MRI are usually normal. But in EEG , is a brain electric function test, found that the frequency are generally slow that explained to long time needed sleep and longer REM in sleeping phase.

Firstly a lengthy listing of other disorders which can ape the symptoms of KLS are to be eliminated. Likely patients are given referrals to endocrinologists earlier on for checking metabolic conditions like hypothyroid condition or diabetes.

Neuropatological Examination of HLA

In a few studies with a neuropathological examinations in encephalitis of viral origin found a slight increasing of HLA-DQB1*0201 allele frequency.

And thereâ€™s also a study with SPECT that there were found a decreased perfusion or nutrition in some part of brain and thatâ€™s NOT hypothalamus.

Slow REM

Phase of sleep in a KLS patient found abnormal, there are couple of decreased and prolonged phase of REM latency, sleep onset periods, or REM sleep repeated interrupted by awakenings and body movement.

What are the treatments?

The Therapy goal mainly to prevent some symptoms such as reducing sleeping time and others complaints. Usually the treatment of KLs consist of :

	Amphetamines
	Methylphenidate
	Modafinil

These are deployed for treating drowsiness, however regrettably they donâ€™t help in improving slack cognitive state or other aspect of changed mental condition. Due to the presence of a number of resemblances amid bipolar &amp; KLS, the use of carbamazepine, lithium are cited to being useful in several situations for staving or lessening the events. Response to therapy has mostly been restricted and thereâ€™s the need for differentiating KLS from cyclical recurrence of drowsiness in the PMS phase in teen girls which might be managed with hormone birth control.
